# Celebrity Linkage (Python, AI/ML)

A celebrity recognition and linkage project built in Python, developed as part of the HarvardX: CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course on edX.

## 🔗 Project Overview

This project identifies whether a given person can be linked to a famous actor (often referred to as the “Kevin Bacon game” style of linkage).
It uses graph search algorithms to determine the shortest path between two actors through their filmography.

## 🛠️ Features

- Find connections between two actors using their shared movie appearances
- Efficient shortest path calculation with Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Handles large datasets of movies and actors
- Provides clear output of the linkage path

## 📚 What I Learned

- Graph representation of real-world data
- Implementing Breadth-First Search (BFS) for shortest path problems
- Working with CSV datasets and data structures (queues, dictionaries, sets)
- Applying AI/ML principles to practical problems
